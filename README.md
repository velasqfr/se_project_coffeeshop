Project Description:
This project took a tole on me, with 4 different parts, all designed to excel and improve my coding skills introduced to me throught Tripleten's platform course. The first part was a brief setup of my git repository. This part of the project had me using terminal to import my files and updated work into git repository. But before that we had use git clone to copy our repository into our vs code. Afterwards, we then used several concepts like "mkdir" to creat new files and folders, "cd" to command us to our directory, "git add" to add any progess and updated work into our repository, and "git push" to ulmultaely have are commits pushed into GitHub. These git commands will be practiced through each project steps, which turned out to be really helpful in practicing what it's like in the real tech world this method.

The second step of the projct took us to creating the layout of the "header" and "recipe" section of the project. Here we needed to write our own code for a change,from scratch, using the appropriate blocks, elements, and coding in our HTML code. Our layout was very similar to Project 2, in where we needed to insert images, use the appropriates styles for background color, fixing the extra margin/padding on the layout, the appropriate font-family and sizing of the text, and of course ensure our navigation links have the appropriate anchor tag to the section of the webpage. What was different for a change was adding video links from Youtube into our website and structuring it appropriately into our webpage though the use of <iframe>. This was really cool to do and in all honesty made me feel like a real web developer.

The third part of our project dealt with adding a form into our webpage. Through the use of <form> and <fieldset> we were able to group elements together in a list and create several input fields and value such as "Name", "Number of guests"(with a scroll bar), Date & Time, and an "Email" input, all with placeholders. In another <fieldset> a button class was inputted along with a checkbox label. This part of the layout showed real interaction with a webpage and introduced a lot of new css styles to incorporate into the classes.

The last part of the project involved adding the "Menu" section along with the footing "About The Coffee Shop" section. But before we worked on our coding here, we first had to organize and structure our files accordingly. We had to create a file for each block (class) within the blocks/folder through the use of terminal. Each file then acted as a self-contained CSS styling code for a single block. Once created, we needed to import it into our pages/index.css file so that it can be applied to our webpage. We did this by applying @import url(../blocks/"block name".css) after every block was created. Now moving back to the html, we practiced using "ul" and "li" again, in the menu\_\_card class, to create a list of the menu items for our page. This resulted in us styling up the font, padding, margin, more background imaging and coloring, all under the construction and adjustment of the layout of the menu in our webpage. However, once we reached the footing section of our webpage, we got the chance to work on some animation style. This particularly applied towards the "about the coffee shop" title, also on some of the content in other sections of the page like the nagivation links on the top of the header, and the submit buttton on the form section. Through the use of keyframes, animation styling, opacity, etc we were able to customize our layout and apply different animation duration, timing, coloring, and more. This style of technique definitely helps pop out the webpage and distinguishes some of the text in the webpage to others in the layout whether by hovering over it, or just on its own (depending on how its applied in the stylesheett).

Improvement:
I think the only 2 suggestions or additions I have to help improve this project is to have more animation styling done, and to add a second layout page that one navigation text link can link to. I know this can add more work to the project, adding extra steps into a whole new webpage layout but I think it can be very useful and beneficial to the student practicing more on these these matierals. The page can contain a survey form to its cutomers, again adding more practce on forms and fieldset.
